      "Lovely, quiet, second floor patio to enjoy a beer and people watch during happy hour. Amazingly friendly and exceptionally hardworking staff from street host to sweetest young man who was serving the entire floor. Close enough to square and far enough to relax. Belly dancing shows every night at 9pm! I came back a second time and the same young man kindly greeted myself and other guests, offering to take photos and even presented sharing dishes.",
